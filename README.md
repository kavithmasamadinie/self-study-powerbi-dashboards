This README is designed as a Portfolio Documentation file. You can use this at the root of a GitHub repository (e.g., named Data-Analytics-Portfolio) to showcase all your self-study work in one place.

I have included the Uber and Customer Behavior projects based on your uploaded files, and the HR Dashboard based on your CV.
